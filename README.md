# Open Port Scanner

I was working with `nmap` on windows but was feeling it very slow on windows. On linux never had an issue with `nmap` and this is not to replace great tool `nmap` but to use on windows where I felt `nmap` slow. 

Therefore, learned few things and worked on this open port scanner with Rust.
